# do not print any intermediate results
# print *only your final* result in the form of a data frame (for clarity)

### what is the average Rating for products in the "Home and lifestyle" Product line?


avg_home_lifestyle_rating = df[df['Product line'] == 'Home and lifestyle']['Rating'].mean()
result = [ ('Home and lifestyle average rating', avg_home_lifestyle_rating)]
pd.DataFrame(result)





### how many products in each Product line were sold during the first week (days 1-7 including) of February 2019?
### use the 'Quantity' column for that purpose - the number of products purchased


df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'], format="%m/%d/%Y", errors='coerce')


cond_1st_week = (df['Date'].dt.day >= 1) & (df['Date'].dt.day <= 7)

### plot a bar chart showing the number of products per category computed in the previous question


product_and_quantity.plot(kind='bar', x='Product line', y='Quantity', title  = 'Quantity per product')
plt.show()





### plot the same bar chart as above - split by gender (male, female)
### the split bar chart is called stacked bar: look up "plot stacked bar charts from a dataframe" to see how to plot it

### what is the total sales ('Total') done by each Payment type during the whole period?
### use the full data in the dataset (not the first week of March) from now on


df.groupby('Payment')['Total'].sum().reset_index()





### plot a chart with total sales ('Total') of the "Sports and travel" products by calendar week (Monday-Sunday): 
### note the first and the last week can be incomplete (for instance, the data starts on Wednesday, and ends on Friday)
### assume all our sales data spans the same year (for instance, 2019)

### you can make use of the isocalendar() function: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/isocalendar-function-of-datetime-date-class-in-python/

### x axis are weeks enumerated from the first to the last calendar week in the data
### y axis is the total sales that week


df['Week'] = df['Date'].dt.isocalendar().week
df_sports = df[df['Product line'] == 'Sports and travel']

plt.show()





### plot a line chart of total sales ('Total') per hour in our dataset
### the x axis will be an hour (e.g., 9, 10, 11), and the y axis will be the total amout of sales during that hour
### (e.g., for 9 - all sales between 09:00 and 10:00)


df['Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Time'], format='%H:%M')
df['Hour'] = df['Time'].dt.hour
total_per_hour = df.groupby('Hour')['Total'].sum()
total_per_hour.plot(kind='line', x='Hour', y='Total', title  = 'total per hour')
plt.show()





### plot a line chart of the total number of purchases (rows) per hour in our dataset
### the x axis will be an hour (e.g., 9, 10, 11), and the y axis will be the total number of purchases during that hour
### (e.g., for 9 - all sales between 09:00 and 10:00)


purchases_per_hour = df.groupby('Hour').size()
purchases_per_hour.plot(kind='line', x='Hour', y='purchases', title  = 'purchases per hour')
plt.show()





### what is the total income of strategic products by City?

### for each non-strategic product (as detailed in the product_types_strategy.csv file), 
###    display break down of total sales by cities - a table with three columns: 
###    (1) product line, (2) city and (3) total sales (the "Total" column) for that line in the city
