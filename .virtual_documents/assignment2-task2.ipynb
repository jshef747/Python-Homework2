### in this task missing values *should be imputed* with the mean value of the column
### impute missing values only in columns required for solutions

### decide what data type each column is: numerical-discrete, numerical-continuous, categorical-nominal, categorical-ordinal
### consider only [price, pages, avg_reviews, n_reviews, language] for this analysis
### no need to add explanations, just the final answer


# price : numerical-continuous
# pages : numerical-discrete
# avg_reviews : numerical-continuous
# n_reviews : numerical-discrete
# language : categorical-nominal





### plot a histogram of books' number of pages using 50 bins
### decide if the distribution is symmetric, skewed positive or skewed negative
### use both the histogram and required computations for this decision


df['pages'].hist(bins = 50)





### inspect the 'weight' column carefully
### plot a histogram of books' weight using 50 bins
### decide if the distribution is symmetric, skewed positive or skewed negative
### use both the histogram and required computations for this decision





### compute Pearson's correlation between a book's volume (inferred by its dimensions) and price in the data
### (you can use the built-in Series.corr() function for that purpose)





### show a scatter plot of a book's volume (inferred by its dimensions) and price
### do the results fit the score you got in the previous cell? (no need to print answer to this question)





### inspect book titles carefully: they can be roughly split by keyphrases:
### ['data science', 'data analytics', 'data engineering', 'machine learning', 'statistics', 
### 'deep learning', 'natural language processing']

### a book belongs to one of the above categories if its name contains the corresponding keyphrase
### display the number of books that fall into each category and their total, in the same table
### some books may not belong to any of the listed above categories
### category match should be case insensitive





### display the same result where the dataframe is sorted by the number of books, descending
### no need to display the total amount in this result - drop it





### sample 10000 values from N~(50, 10)
### for this pirpose use https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.normal.html

### what portion of the distribution is found in the range (42.5, 57.5)? -- calculate using z table
### (recall the NormalDist().cdf() function we used at the lecture)

### what portion of the distribution is found in the range (42.5, 57.5)? -- compute empirically using the sampled values
### report both values (calculated and empirical)





### compute confidence interval of 90% for the true population mean of a book price on Amazon
### report left and right boundaries





### can one say with 85% confidence that the true population mean of a book price resides within the [49.0, 54.0] interval?
### show your computations, and print your answer: yes or no
